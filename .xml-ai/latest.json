So, when you compare a kilogram (of anything, feathers, steel, etc.) to a pound (of anything), the kilogram will always be heavier. \n\nSo, a kilogram of feathers is heavier than a pound of steel, not because of what they are made of, but because a kilogram is a larger unit of mass than a pound."

The objects in question aren't relevant in this comparison, it's the units of measurement. A kilogram is a larger measure of mass than a pound. In fact, it's about 2.2 times larger. So regardless of the material--feathers, steel, or otherwise--a kilogram of it will be heavier than a pound of something else."
